Most importantly, we nowadays use functional components + React Hooks instead of using class-based components for state management.</p><p>Whilst I&nbsp;do cover React Hooks in-depth in this course, the course still starts with a strong focus on class-based components (just like the official docs still do by the way). That is not bad or incorrect but it doesn't reflect the future of React. And hence, to make this course future-proof and teach you&nbsp;React in the most modern way possible, I&nbsp;updated the course to fully embrace functional components +&nbsp;React Hooks.</p><h4>What changed?</h4><p>I also used the opportunity to improve the content in general and add some new content (besides the general restructuring due to the switch to "React Hooks first"):</p><ul><li><p>The single, large course project (the burger builder)&nbsp;will be replaced by <strong>multiple smaller, more focused (yet realistic)&nbsp;demo projects</strong> so that skipping modules or coming back to modules will be easier (and so that you got more variety!)</p></li><li><p>A brand-new, <strong>in-depth introduction to Next.js</strong> (&gt; 3h!) was added to the course</p></li><li><p>A <strong>React summary module</strong> was added:&nbsp;You can use that after going through the course or as a "mini course"&nbsp;that teaches you the essence of React =&gt;&nbsp;Great if you have limited time and don't want to go through the full course right now</p></li><li><p>Overall, explanations and examples were improved, as I&nbsp;had to create a brand-new course anyways (due to the switch to "React Hooks first")</p></li><li><p><strong>More new content</strong> (on<strong> React + TypeScript,</strong> <strong>Authentication</strong>, <strong>Testing</strong>)&nbsp;will be <strong>added after May 3rd</strong> (once the old lectures were removed) - I can't add that content yet since there is a "maximum number of lectures"&nbsp;limitation on Udemy</p></li></ul><h4>What about the old course?</h4><p>As mentioned, the old content stays around for a <strong>short transitional period until May 3rd</strong> - thereafter it will be removed. You will <strong>keep access to it thereafter via download links</strong> though (see next lecture).</p><p>Because Udemy has a lecture limit (max amount of published lectures), I also had to remove some less important old content right away:&nbsp;The Webpack section, the old, short Next.js section, the old Deployment section, the Redux Saga section.</p><p>All those sections are of course still available via download!</p><h4>How should you proceed?</h4><p>How you should proceed depends on your current status:</p><ol><li><p>You haven't started the course yet or you haven't progressed much yet <strong><em>("NOT&nbsp;STARTED")</em></strong></p></li><li><p>You are well into the course already and you're currently doing the course <strong><em>("WELL&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;THE&nbsp;COURSE")</em></strong></p></li><li><p>You completed the course in the past or you haven't visited it for a longer time period <strong><em>("COMPLETED&nbsp;/&nbsp;PAUSED")</em></strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>NOT&nbsp;STARTED</strong></p><ul><li><p>Simply restart with the updated course (i.e. take lecture 1 in section 1 to start the new course)</p></li><li><p>Ignore the old course content, the new course will teach you everything in a better way</p></li></ul><p><strong>WELL&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;THE&nbsp;COURSE</strong></p><ul><li><p>Consider restarting if you have the time:&nbsp;The new course will contain sharpened explanations, new demos and examples and is arguably a bit better than the old one</p></li><li><p>But you can also just finish the existing course (in the transitional period until May 3rd or by downloading the old course content, see next lecture)</p></li><li><p>You will still learn React in a best-practice way!&nbsp;You will learn all about React Hooks =&gt;&nbsp;It's just the strong focus on class-based components which is not as important anymore</p></li><li><p><strong>Definitely explore the recommended new content you find below!</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>COMPLETED&nbsp;/&nbsp;PAUSED</strong></p><ul><li><p>You can ignore the update in general as you did still learn React in a best-practice way!&nbsp;You did learn all about React Hooks =&gt;&nbsp;It's just the strong focus on class-based components which is not as important anymore</p></li><li><p>If you have the time, definitely consider taking the full course again:&nbsp;It will contain sharpened explanations, new demos and examples and simply is better than the old one!</p></li><li><p><strong>Definitely explore the recommended new content you find below!</strong></p></li></ul><h4>New Content Which You Definitely Should Explore</h4><ul><li><p>The <strong>new first ("Getting Started") module</strong> to get an overview of the new course</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Next.js introduction module</strong></p></li><li><p>The <strong>React.js summary module</strong></p></li><li><p>The new <strong>Routing</strong> ("Building a Multi-Page SPA with React Router") module</p></li><li><p>The new <strong>Redux sections</strong> =&gt;&nbsp;They now also include <strong>Redux Toolkit</strong>!</p></li><li><p>The new <strong>Testing</strong> section <em>(released on May 3rd)</em></p></li><li><p>The new <strong>Authentication</strong> section <em>(released on May 3rd)</em></p></li><li><p>The new <strong>React +&nbsp;TypeScript</strong> section <em>(released on May 3rd)</em></p></li><li><p>All the new <strong>"Project"&nbsp;or "Practice"&nbsp;course sections</strong> where we build demo apps</p></li></ul><h4>Frequently asked questions</h4><p><strong>What about my course progress /&nbsp;course completion certificate?</strong></p><p><em>Unfortunately, since the new course was inserted into this existing course, your course progress is reset / diluted. </em></p><p><em>But you get a complete new course with many improvements for free! It's probably worth it ;-)</em></p><p><em>To regain your course progress and certificate, you can simply mark lectures as completed manually. It's annoying but will only take a few minutes.</em></p><p><strong>What about my notes or existing threads in the Q&amp;A section (for the old content)?</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, notes and existing Q&amp;A&nbsp;threads will be lost, once the old content is removed (i.e. lectures are unpublished). Udemy doesn't offer a way of saving that data at the moment - that is beyond my control.</p><p><strong>Why didn't you create a new course?</strong></p><p><em>I wanted to make this update available for free!</em></p><p><em>There also is no possible way on Udemy to offer a brand-new course for free (without leaking it to the entire world) anymore, hence this is the best approach going forward. It also ensures that no student misses this update!</em></p><p><strong>Will you remove the old content?</strong></p><p><em>Yes, please see above.</em></p><p><strong>Why will you remove the old content?</strong></p><p><em>Because it unnecessarily bloats the course, makes it look bigger than it is and forces students to go through two courses instead of one. Keeping it around therefore is only a temporary workaround.</em></p><p><strong>I have another question!</strong></p><p><em>If it wasn't answered in this article already, feel free to ask in the Q&amp;A - I'll do my best to help there!&nbsp;:)</em></p>
