<p><strong>Attached to this lecture you find download links to the old course content </strong>(by sections). </p><p>Each ZIP&nbsp;file contains the videos, VTT&nbsp;captions and code attachments for the section.</p><p>You <strong>should ignore that old course content</strong> if you took / are taking the updated course - the new course is more detailed and simply better.</p><p><em>Unfortunately, Udemy messed up the attachment order (and I can't change that order), so don't get confused by that :)</em></p>
